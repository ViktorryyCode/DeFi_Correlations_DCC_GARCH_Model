# DeFi_Correlations_DCC_GARCH_Model
DCC MGARCH Model
In 2022, the collapse of Terra Luna, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, caused a loss of 200 billion in just 24 hours. This study aims to investigate the effects of this collapse on the correlations between digital and traditional assets, as well as identify potential ways to minimize the inherent risks of such collapses in the future. As DeFi technologies continue to go unregulated, there is a potential for large exposure to traditional finance. Therefore, it is important to identify ways to minimize the inherent risks of such collapses and provide stakeholders with insights for hedging, portfolio management, and the formulation of regulation for consumer protection. The study applies a multivariate DCC GARCH model in R to answer the empirical research question. The results indicate increased volatility during the crash but do not provide sufficient evidence or statistical significance to reject the null hypothesis. Further findings highlight the difficulty in providing solutions for the minimization of risks to collapses such as that of Terra Luna outside of regulation and investor caution.
